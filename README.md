# Solar-Explorer-WWDC22
My winning submission to the WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge. In this simulation you are able to create individual planets and run genetic simulations on each planet.

**The following assumes you are on macOS**
To use the project...
1. Download the repository as a zip
2. Extract the Terran Integration Application .zip
3. Open the included .playgroundbook in Swift Playgrounds for macOS or iPadOS
   - Runs much better on a mac, mostly because of the speed at which it can update the SwiftUI views.
   - If I was doing this again I would have used Core Graphics to render everything instead of SwiftUI. It would be much faster.
4. Run the proejct in Swift Playgrounds

To view the source code...
1. Download the repository as a zip
2. Extract the Terran Integration Application .zip
3. Right click on the  Terran Integration Application.playgroundbook and selected "Show Package Contents"
4. Navigate to Contents -> Modules -> Core.playgroundmodule -> Sources
   - This folder includes all of the Core code and UI code.
